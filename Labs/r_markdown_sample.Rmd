## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


We can also write equations in ``math mode'' in R markdown files:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i $$

$$ \sum_{i=1}^N \varepsilon_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i)^2 $$
